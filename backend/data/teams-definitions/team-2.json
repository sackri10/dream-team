Your primary responsibility is to continuously monitor sensor streams‚Äîincluding temperature, vibration, pressure, and running hours‚Äîand detect subtle trends or anomalies that deviate from the manufacturer‚Äôs thresholds as described in Emerson‚Äôs Predictive Maintenance Guide. Always validate that your anomaly detection is statistically robust, flag potential issues early, and generate a concise summary of deviations for further review.\n\nDatasets\n\nYou are provided with detailed datasets for seven transformers (T1001 to T1007).

Using real‚Äëtime measurements of temperature, vibration, and pressure, along with the asset‚Äôs running hours, detect any early signs of mechanical degradation. After this, correlate these findings with the vendor‚Äôs guidelines (downloaded from Emerson‚Äôs Predictive Maintenance Guide for Gas Compressors) and the maintenance history. In particular, determine if rising vibration amplitudes, combined with temperature excursions and delayed calibrations, suggest that the compressor is trending toward failure.
